# Web Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview

This tool is designed to scan web applications for common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Requirements

### Required Libraries

The following Python libraries are required to run the scanner:

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

### Python Version

Ensure that you are using Python 3.6 or higher.

### Files Overview

- **`main.py`**: Entry point for running the scanner. It prompts the user for a URL and displays the scan results.
- **`scanner.py`**: Handles the core scanning logic, including checking for SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities.
- **`report.py`**: Generates a report based on the scanning results.
- **`modules/sql_injection.py`**: Contains the logic for detecting SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
- **`modules/xss.py`**: Contains the logic for detecting XSS vulnerabilities.
- **`test_scanner.py`**: Contains unit tests to verify the functionality of the scanner.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd web_vulnerability_scanner
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4
    ```

4. **Run the Scanner**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    When prompted, enter the URL of the web application you wish to scan (e.g., `www.example.com`). The tool will automatically add the `http://` schema if omitted.

5. **View Results**:
    - The scanner will output a report indicating whether the target is vulnerable to SQL Injection or XSS.

## Usage Example

```bash
python main.py
Enter the URL to scan: www.facebook.com
```

The above example will scan `http://www.facebook.com` for vulnerabilities and display the results.

## Important Notes

- **Permissions**: Make sure you have permission to scan any website you target with this tool to avoid legal issues.
- **Limitations**: This is a basic scanner and may not detect all possible vulnerabilities. It is meant for educational purposes and as a starting point for more comprehensive tools.
